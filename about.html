    <h2>About Our Products</h2>
    <p>Here at Pure Joy, our goal is to provide an all-natural lip balm that is as nourishing as possible. We have spent over a year curating the best ingredients and perfecting a formula rich in vitamin E to create our line of carefully-crafted, ultra-hydrating lip balms.</p> 
    <p>Our balms begin with sunflower seed oil, which helps our lips retain their moisture and protect them from the sun. Next we use beeswax sourced locally here in Iowa. Beeswax acts as another protective barrier from the environment and like sunflower oil, it helps the lips retain moisture. We also use coconut oil, which contains fatty acids to lock away additional moisture to prevent cracked, dry lips. Finally shea butter reduces inflammation, and softens our lips.</p>

  <h2>Our Story <small>a personal message from the creator of Pure Joy</small></h2>
  <img src="hannah.jpg" class="col-lg-4">
  <p class="col-lg-8">On a January day several years ago, I woke deciding that I wanted to do something for my friends for Valentine's Day. I've always disliked Valentine's Day because I feel that it glorifies romantic love over all the other kinds of love there are. After some reflection, I resolved to make homemade Valentines, as I did when I was a child, to remind them how much they mean to me. I also resolved to send along a little something extra for them to use, something handmade with love and care.</p>
  <p>I grew up in New Jersey, but had recently moved to Minneapolis only a few months earlier, and so most of my friends were still living back east. I had to be creative. Searching Pinterest and other similar sites, I came across some formulas for DIY lip balms. This was an intriguing idea, I thought, so I ordered the ingredients and picked up some beeswax from my local honey lady. It wasn't long before I was in production! My very first balm flavors were peppermint lavender and rosemary lavender, and I sent them out to my friends.</p>
  <p>My friends were kind, humoring me by saying they loved the lip balm, but I knew that it needed some serious work. So I set out to make the best lip balm ever. Over the course of the next twelve months, I experimented with my recipe, adding ingredients, taking some away, changing ratios. I also explored different essential oil combinations to determine which ones smelled best. I gave a lip balm away with each and every batch, asking people to report back after using the product for about a month. By the following Valentine's Day, my recipe had been perfected.</p>
  <p>Not long after, it was time once again to send out my annual Valentine's gift to my friends. This time they approved with conviction. I continued to give lip balms away as gifts, and pretty soon I found people desired to buy them. Although this was never my mission, I decided to discuss it with my husband Fig and take some time to pray about it.</p> 
  <p>In the following months, I felt the Lord telling me that this was a gift that I should use for his glory in the name of pure joy. So I decided to start a business, with our first product being "Pure Joy . . . for your Lips!" I knew that the supplemental income would help my husband and I, who travel most of the year on a tour bus with the Christian band <i>Bread of Stone. </i>But I also felt in my heart that the Lord wanted more from Pure Joy. So a few weeks after I began selling my lip balms to friends and family, I decided to give a percentage of our proceeds to a cause very near to my heart, Corrie's House. 
  <p>My dear friend Abby is the force behind Corrie's House, a Christian home still in the beginning stages of development that will be dedicated to empowering victims of sex trafficking. The Lord put this calling in her heart in early 2014, and she has been following ever since. You can read more about them by clicking here. Pure Joy is devoted to giving 10% of all of our profitss directly to Corrie's House so that Abby and her team can become that much closer to helping these women.</p>
